# report-engine
Very simple HTML report generation using FastAPI post data and Jinja2 templates.

## Background
I needed a simple report generator that could receive HTTP POST data, apply that to an HTML template to produce a report, and return the url to the new report.  This project scratches that itch.  
Also, I wanted to try out [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).  Which, by the way, I like. :smiley:
